      "summary": "Passionate about computer science for several years, I started my journey with a BTS SIO, where I acquired solid foundations in development and system management. Wanting to deepen my knowledge, I continued with a BUT in Computer Science, allowing me to perfect my skills in software development, system architecture, and software engineering. I love designing optimized and well-structured applications, applying SOLID principles and best development practices. My expertise spans several technologies, including PHP, TypeScript, SQL, and Linux, with a particular interest in software architectures and backend systems. Always curious and eager to learn, I enjoy taking on new technical challenges and exploring innovative solutions to design high-performance and scalable applications."
